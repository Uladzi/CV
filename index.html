        <h2>Reason for Applying for a Job:</h2>
        <p class="summary-heading"><strong>PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE</strong></p c>
        <p class="summary-body">Until recent time my professional activity hasn't been directly connected to IT sphere. During last 5 years I've been involved into international financing projects. Work in this sphere allowed me to develop not only professional skills, but also
          personal qualities such as teamwork and problem-solving abilities, adaptability, high-organization and open-mindedness.</p>
        <p class="summary-heading"><strong>WHY IT SPHERE</strong></p>
        <p class="summary-body">IT sphere and modern technologies have always been interesting and attractive to me because of their dynamism and perspective. Several years ago I even started studying one of programming languages. But I realized that if you run after two hares,
          you will catch neither. That's why I focused on current activity then. Probably that gave me an opportunity to grow from one implementing international financing projects to one managing this implementation.<br>
        But when time came to make another vital choice, I’ve understood that I’m ready to take the challenge.</p>
        <p class="summary-heading"><strong>WHY ME</strong></p>
        <p class="summary-body">I'm responsible and decent, eager to improve my knowledge constantly, ready to learn and develop according to specifics of activity. I always look for positive sides in negative situations.<br>
        I understand that it's not an easy way and being a Junior software developer means to study hard and all the time both from mentors and by myself.</p>
