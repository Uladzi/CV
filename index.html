                <h2>Reason for applying for a job:</h2>
                <p><strong>PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
                <p>Until recent time my professional activity hasn't been directly connected to IT sphere. During last 5 years I've been involved into international financing projects. Work in this sphere allowed me to develop not only professional skills,
                    but also personal qualities such as teamwork and problem-solving abilities, adaptability, high-organization and open-mindedness.</p>
                <p><strong>WHY IT SPHERE</strong></p>
                <p>IT sphere and modern technologies have always been interesting and attractive to me because of their dynamism and perspective. Several years ago I even started studying one of programming languages. But I realized that if you run after
                    two hares, you will catch neither. That's why I focused on current activity then. Probably that gave me an opportunity to grow from one implementing international financing projects to one managing this implementation.</p>
                <p> But when time came to make another vital choice, I’ve understood that I’m ready to take the challenge. So, at present I’m interested in professional development exactly in IT sphere.
                </p>
                <p><strong>WHY SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
                <p>For me it’s important to focus completely on the deal and to study the technical aspect to the very details. I’m inspired by the opportunity to be involved into software development process. </p>
                <p><strong>WHY ME</strong></p>
                <p>I'm responsible and decent, eager to improve my knowledge constantly, ready to learn and develop according to specifics of activity. I always look for positive sides in negative situations.</p>
                <p>I understand that it's not an easy way and being a Junior software developer means to study hard and all the time both from mentors and by myself.
